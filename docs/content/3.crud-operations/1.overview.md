CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are the foundation of database interactions. Learn how to work with your data in MongoDB.

## Overview

gmsv_mongo provides comprehensive CRUD methods for both single and bulk operations:

| Operation | Single | Bulk | Description |
|-----------|--------|------|-------------|
| **Create** | `InsertOne` | `InsertMany` | Add new documents |
| **Read** | `FindOne`, `Find` | - | Retrieve documents |
| **Update** | `UpdateOne` | `UpdateMany` | Modify documents |
| **Delete** | `DeleteOne` | `DeleteMany` | Remove documents |

title: Async Operations Available!
---
Every CRUD operation has an **async version** (e.g., `InsertOneAsync()`, `FindOneAsync()`) that accepts callbacks. **Use async in production to prevent server lag!**

The examples below use **synchronous** operations for simplicity. In production servers, use the async versions with callbacks!
::

### Create Operations

```lua
-- Insert one document
local id = collection:InsertOne({ name = "Player1", level = 5 })

-- Insert many documents
local ids = collection:InsertMany({
    { name = "Player1", level = 5 },
    { name = "Player2", level = 10 }
})
```

### Read Operations

```lua
-- Find multiple documents
local results = collection:Find({ level = { ["$gte"] = 5 } }, 10)

-- Find one document
local doc = collection:FindOne({ name = "Player1" })

-- Count documents
local count = collection:Count({ active = true })
```

### Update Operations

```lua
-- Update one document
local updated = collection:UpdateOne(
    { name = "Player1" },
    { ["$set"] = { level = 10 } }
)

-- Update many documents
local updated = collection:UpdateMany(
    { active = true },
    { ["$inc"] = { credits = 100 } }
)
```

### Delete Operations

```lua
-- Delete one document
local deleted = collection:DeleteOne({ name = "Player1" })

-- Delete many documents
local deleted = collection:DeleteMany({ active = false })
```
