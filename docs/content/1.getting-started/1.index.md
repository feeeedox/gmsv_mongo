## Quick Example

Here's a taste of what you can do with gmsv_mongo:

```lua
require("mongo")

-- Connect to MongoDB
local client = MongoDB.Client("mongodb://localhost:27017")
local db = client:Database("gameserver")
local players = db:Collection("players")

-- Save player data
local id = players:InsertOne({
    steamid = "STEAM_0:1:12345",
    username = "Player1",
    level = 5,
    credits = 1000,
    inventory = {
        { item = "weapon_pistol", amount = 1 },
        { item = "ammo_pistol", amount = 50 }
    }
})

-- Find high-level players
local veterans = players:Find({ 
    level = { ["$gte"] = 10 } 
}, 10)

-- Update player credits
players:UpdateOne(
    { steamid = "STEAM_0:1:12345" },
    { ["$inc"] = { credits = 500 } }
)

-- Get statistics with aggregation
local stats = players:Aggregate({
    {
        ["$group"] = {
            _id = nil,
            avgLevel = { ["$avg"] = "$level" },
            totalPlayers = { ["$sum"] = 1 }
        }
    }
})
```
