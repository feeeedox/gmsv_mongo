## Quick Examples
### Aggregation
```lua
local stats = players:Aggregate({
    {
        ["$group"] = {
            _id = "$rank",
            count = { ["$sum"] = 1 },
            avgLevel = { ["$avg"] = "$level" }
        }
    },
    {
        ["$sort"] = { count = -1 }
    }
})
```
### Indexes
```lua
-- Create index
players:CreateIndex({ steamid = 1 }, true, "steamid_unique")
-- List indexes  
local indexes = players:ListIndexes()
-- Drop index
players:DropIndex("old_index")
```
### Database Operations
```lua
-- List collections
local collections = db:ListCollections()
-- Get stats
local stats = db:Stats("players")
-- Drop collection
db:DropCollection("old_data")
```
